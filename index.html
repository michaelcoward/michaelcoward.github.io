				<h2>Introduction</h2>
			</header>
			<p>Hi, my name is Michael Coward and I am a student currently enrolled in the program ‘Bachelor of Technology (Computing Studies)’ at RMIT (Melbourne campus). My student number is S3720274 and can be contacted by email at: s3720274@student.rmit.edu.au.</p>

				<h2>My Background</h2>
			</header>
			
				<section>
					<h3>General</h3>
					<p>While my Mother is a native of California, USA, and I am indeed fortunate enough to have dual-citizenship for both Australia and USA, I have spent and lived my entire life as an Australian resident. In my first few years of life I lived in Toowoomba, QLD, where I was born, and then went on to live in the outer Northern suburbs of Melbourne and complete all 13 years of my primary and secondary education there. </p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Current Education</h3>
					<p>My formal education to date is completing the VCE via high-school and I am aiming to further that education in the IT field at RMIT.</p>
				</section>
				
				
				<section>
					<h3>Interests and pursuits</h3>
					<p>Naturally, I have interests and pursuits outside of IT that I enjoy. Basketball is one of these, and while I’m not as competitively invested as I maybe once was, I still enjoy it more casually and play weekly in a Sunday-nights league with some of my mates as well as follow the NBA as a 76er’s fan. Other interests and pursuits I enjoy and/or take VERY seriously include gaming, petting dogs and recently, learning to draw.</p>

				<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
			</header>	
				<section>
					<h3>General</h3>
					<p>My interests within IT are quite broad at this stage as I am only a year out of high-school and am still in the very early stages of my studies within the IT field. Nevertheless, programming is the most interesting to me and was the main factor to draw me in to the field. Being able to think creatively and create unique programs to solve problems and/or bring joy to others is the primary reason for my interest. The potential for skills in IT to facilitate entrepreneurship and it’s need in almost every industry are also strong causes for my interest in IT. </p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h3>Causes of my interest</h3>
					<p>The YouTube video ‘What Most Schools Don’t Teach’ posted by Code.org and a co-worker who would tell me about his Computer Science program both contributed largely to sparking my interest in IT. I had no prior IT experience upon enrolling and beginning my studies at RMIT. </p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h3>Choosing RMIT</h3>
					<p>I chose RMIT as my University of choice because it was the only University in my area that offered Biotechnology as a program which is what I was initially enrolled in. After taking a gap year, my interests and ideals shifted so I sought a transfer in to a IT related program. Paired with the convenience of already being considered a current student at RMIT, and RMIT’s good reputation for its Computer Science and Information Systems programs, I was encouraged to stick with RMIT. </p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h3>Expectations of my future learning</h3>
					<p>I expect to learn how to create basic programs from the ground up to act and behave in ways that I intend. In addition, I expect to learn and discover in a more specific sense what interests me within IT and how I can pursue that as a career further down the line. I also assume I will receive a concrete foundation of knowledge to apply to other areas not covered during my studies to assist further learning if I so choose.</p>

				<h2>My ideal job</h2>
			</header>
				<section>
					<h3>DISCLAIMER:</h3>
					<p>At this stage of my studies, I don’t have a clear idea of what avenue of IT I would like to go down and as such, the reasons for my ideal job choice are not heavily dictated by the actual tasks I will be carrying out daily in this position (as unintuitive as that sounds). Normally a natural interest/enjoyment of the tasks required of me in a given position would be of high priority however, in this case, my choice is more-so dictated by the supplementary factors that can influence whether one becomes interested in a job or not. </p>
				</section>
					
				<section>
					<h3>Position</h3>
				<!-- Job position image -->
				<img src="Job position.jpg" style="width:386px;height:872px;">
					<p>The ‘Senior Java Developer’ position posted by ‘justdigitalpeople.’ is a role that will involve working as a java developer to produce quality code for them and a partnered SaaS business. It is an ideal job for me because it’s very high paying in which they are offering up to $150K + superannuation. A high paying position is important to me for more than just the obvious perks of consumption; a high salary can also enable me to inch closer to financial independence or retirement. This job is attractive because you can work from home, granting some flexibility in hours and being able to work with independence and a sense of freedom. The final aspect of this position that I find appealing, is that they only want two developers to work with a Development Manager, which means I would be working in a small, personal team where my individual contributions make an impact instead of being a tiny cog in a large team, in a massive corporation. </p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h3>Skills, qualifications, experience required</h3>
					<p>The position requires being a senior Java developer and have expertise in a stack of different technology which include java, Spring, Microservices, REST API, MySQL and PostgreSQL. The role also requires an all-rounder capable of learning new technologies quickly.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h3>Skills, qualifications, experience I possess</h3>
					<p>As a young student, I have very little skills, qualifications or experience in the IT field. I most definitely lack the necessities of the ideal job I chose. I have an extremely basic understanding of some introductory Java programming concepts, a Victorian Certificate of Education and no industry experience whatsoever.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h3>Plan to achieve the skills, qualifications and experience required</h3>
					<p>I will first complete my tertiary education graduating with a Bachelor of Technology (Computing studies) or similar IT-related program if I choose to change. Then I will set my sights on a junior Java programming role of some kind to gain experience and build upon my skills. I could either continue with my current position if it offers a lot of opportunity for growth or look elsewhere for new more challenging positions that ideally can provide a way to learn the various technologies in the tech stack. Along the way I will if necessary complete online courses or self-teach with the help of the internet on how to become proficient at using the various technologies in the required tech stack that I have not yet learned through my previous positions.</p>

				<section>
					<h3>Meaning of my results</h3>
					<p>My learning style results indicated that I am primarily a visual learner and therefore should approach my learning and development of skills through the use of visual stimuli. As such I should try and visualise things that I hear to enhance my learning as well as prioritise a variety of other learning strategies such as draw pictures to assist in explaining key concepts, utilise colour coding and use flashcards. My creativity test results were slightly-below average which means I could work on improving my creativity through a variety of exercises to potentially enhance my performance in the workplace or improve my odds of receiving a job. For the Myers-Briggs Personality test I received ‘INTJ-The architect’. The combination of having a tendency of being independent and decisive as well as loathing highly structured environments (which on my own personal account does seem accurate), likely means I will be more inclined to reject/dislike career positions that are over-controlling and micro-managed.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h3>Significance of results in my behaviour within a team</h3>
					<p>The 16 Personalities website provides explanation on ‘Architects’ tendencies in the workplace setting and suggests “Active teamwork is not ideal for people with the Architect personality type.... Architects use their nimble minds and insight to deflect personal talk, avoid workplace tension, and create situations where they aren’t slowed down..." [1] This means I may need to be careful in future endeavours with who I choose to work in team with, and that I may get frustrated if things aren’t done my way. The results of my creativity test indicate that I should ensure I encourage and rely on my team for the development of new ideas.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h3>Taking my results in to account when forming teams</h3>
					<p>The 16 Personalities website provides explanation on ‘Architects’ tendencies in their careers and suggests “Architects tend to prefer to work alone, or at most in small groups, where they can maximize their creativity and focus without repeated interruptions from questioning colleagues and meetings-happy supervisors.” [2] The Myers-Briggs personality test therefore indicates that I should probably endeavour to form teams in small groups rather than large groups when possible and try and stick with those that think in a similar fashion to myself. The creativity test results suggest that I should prioritise finding teammates that are creative thinkers when forming a team to cover my lack of creativity.</p>

		<!-- Project Idea -->

				<h2>Project Idea</h2>
			</header>
				<section>
					<h3>Overview</h3>
					<p>My idea is to create a single player, linear, 2D platforming action game using the Unity engine with a pixel art style. The concept of the game involves starting the game playing as a lowly unidentifiable creature/animal that would belong somewhere close to the bottom of the food chain and progressively work through levels of platforming that become more difficult as you progress. At the end of each level, there will be a boss encounter of a slightly more advanced form of animal life. Upon defeating the boss encounter, your unidentifiable creature will gain a trait of the animal it defeats and be able to apply those newfound traits to help it navigate the evolving challenges of the environment you are trying to traverse as well as help you defeat new more challenging boss encounters. The goal of the game is to become the ultimate life-form.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h3>Motivation</h3>
					<p> My motivation mainly stems from nostalgia and ideas I had as a kid for what would be a fun and exciting game to play. Some of my inspiration draws from a platforming flash-game I played as a kid called ‘Monster Evolution’ and one of my all-time favourite games through childhood, Spore. Games that are centred on evolution being delivered in an exciting way have always been a huge love of mine, and as such, with this game I could deliver this experience through a unique filter and give many kids that memorable experience that I enjoyed so much when I was younger. </p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>The game will involve a set of linear levels where you cannot progress until you have completed the level you are currently on. However, as the creature you play as becomes more advanced and has more traits at it’s disposal, the ways in which you can traverse and solve problems within the environment can become a choice. An example would be utlising the traits of a rat that can pass through tight spaces in a forest or using the traits of a monkey to climb to high places to get to different platforms. </p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
					<p>The Unity engine is of course required as a popular platform for indie games. The beginners package for Unity is free however it’s capabilities are limited and a monetised UnityPlus or UnityPro package may become required as the needs of the project become more clear. Some form of graphic design technology/program may also be required such as photo shop to create concept art before being integrated in to the game. My knowledge of what is needed to create an indie videogame is limited as I am yet to go through the process and lack any experience in this area.</p>
