				<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<p>Hi, my name is Michael Coward and I am a student currently enrolled in the program ‘Bachelor of Technology (Computing Studies)’ at RMIT (Melbourne campus). My student number is S3720274 and can be contacted by email at: s3720274@student.rmit.edu.au.</p>

				<h2>My Background</h2>

				<section>
					<h3>General</h3>
					<p>While my Mother is a native of California, USA, and I am indeed fortunate enough to have dual-citizenship for both Australia and USA, I have spent and lived my entire life as an Australian resident. In my first few years of life I lived in Toowoomba, QLD, where I was born, and then went on to live in the outer Northern suburbs of Melbourne and complete all 13 years of my primary and secondary education there. </p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Current Education</h3>
					<p>My formal education to date is completing the VCE via high-school and I am aiming to further that education in the IT field at RMIT.</p>
				</section>
				
				
				<section>
					<h3>Interests and pursuits</h3>
					<p>Naturally, I have interests and pursuits outside of IT that I enjoy. Basketball is one of these, and while I’m not as competitively invested as I maybe once was, I still enjoy it more casually and play weekly in a Sunday-nights league with some of my mates as well as follow the NBA as a 76er’s fan. Other interests and pursuits I enjoy and/or take VERY seriously include gaming, petting dogs and recently, learning to draw.</p>

				<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
			</header>	
				<section>
					<h3>General</h3>
					<p>My interests within IT are quite broad at this stage as I am only a year out of high-school and am still in the very early stages of my studies within the IT field. Nevertheless, programming is the most interesting to me and was the main factor to draw me in to the field. Being able to think creatively and create unique programs to solve problems and/or bring joy to others is the primary reason for my interest. The potential for skills in IT to facilitate entrepreneurship and it’s need in almost every industry are also strong causes for my interest in IT. </p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h3>Causes of my interest</h3>
					<p>The YouTube video ‘What Most Schools Don’t Teach’ posted by Code.org and a co-worker who would tell me about his Computer Science program both contributed largely to sparking my interest in IT. I had no prior IT experience upon enrolling and beginning my studies at RMIT. </p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h3>Choosing RMIT</h3>
					<p>I chose RMIT as my University of choice because it was the only University in my area that offered Biotechnology as a program which is what I was initially enrolled in. After taking a gap year, my interests and ideals shifted so I sought a transfer in to a IT related program. Paired with the convenience of already being considered a current student at RMIT, and RMIT’s good reputation for its Computer Science and Information Systems programs, I was encouraged to stick with RMIT. </p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h3>Expectations of my future learning</h3>
					<p>I expect to learn how to create basic programs from the ground up to act and behave in ways that I intend. In addition, I expect to learn and discover in a more specific sense what interests me within IT and how I can pursue that as a career further down the line. I also assume I will receive a concrete foundation of knowledge to apply to other areas not covered during my studies to assist further learning if I so choose.</p>

					<h3>DISCLAIMER:</h3>
					<p>At this stage of my studies, I don’t have a clear idea of what avenue of IT I would like to go down and as such, the reasons for my ideal job choice are not heavily dictated by the actual tasks I will be carrying out daily in this position (as unintuitive as that sounds). Normally a natural interest/enjoyment of the tasks required of me in a given position would be of high priority however, in this case, my choice is more-so dictated by the supplementary factors that can influence whether one becomes interested in a job or not. </p>
